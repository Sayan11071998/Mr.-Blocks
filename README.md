# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Mr. Block! 🚀***

🌟 Introducing my latest project: Mr. Block, a 2D puzzle-arcade game packed with creative mechanics, challenging levels, and modern design twists! 💻🎯

## **🎨 ✨ Highlights of Mr. Block:**
- ***🎮 Strategic Player Movement:*** Implemented smooth controls using Rigidbody2D in Dynamic mode with zero gravity, all scripted for precise gameplay. 🎯
- ***🦠 Challenging Enemies:*** Designed spike ball enemies with randomized movement patterns that will keep you on your toes! ⚔️
- ***🏁 Goal-Oriented Levels:*** Navigate complex mazes, dodge spike balls, and race to the finish line. Are you up for the challenge? 🏃‍♂️
- ***📊 Dynamic UI:*** Created real-time UI to track the current level and guide the player seamlessly through the game. 📋
- ***🌌 Creative Level Design:*** Built hand-crafted mazes with obstacles and strategically placed enemies for maximum engagement (and frustration 😅).
- ***🎥 Special Effects:*** Added a camera shake effect for those epic, heart-pounding moments. 🎬💥
- ***📋 Smooth Game Flow:*** Designed polished Main Menu, Game Over, and Game Completed screens for a seamless player experience. 🖱️✨
- ***🎶 Sound System Optimization:*** Scripted an efficient audio system for background music 🎵 and sound effects 🔊 to elevate the gaming vibe.

## **✨ Key Learnings:**
- 📈 Strengthened my Unity and C# scripting skills, particularly for custom gameplay mechanics.
- 🧠 Overcame challenges like creating dynamic enemy behaviors and optimizing enemy placement for a balanced experience.
- 🎨 Learned the art of crafting engaging maze designs (still improving, though 😅).
- 🌌 Mastered scripting features like:
- 🎥 Camera shake with customizable time and magnitude.
- 💀 Player death logic, stopping all enemy movement dynamically.
- 📊 Level tracking UI and switching between Game Over and Game Completed screens.

## **💡 Fun Fact:**
I’ve only completed the full level once in all my tries! Maybe I need to “git good” at gaming 🤷‍♂️😅.
